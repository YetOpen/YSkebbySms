DESCRIPTION
===========
YiiFramework extension that helps you send SMS messages using Skebby API with only one line of code.
You need a Skebby subscription to send messages.

INSTALLATION
============
1. Copy the YSkebbySms folder to your *extensions* folder (usually in protected/extensions/)
   If you prefeer to clone,
    git clone https://github.com/YetOpen/YSkebbySms.git protected/extensions/YSkebbySms
2. In configuration, add the following component:

'components' => array(
	...
	'skebbySms' => array(
		'class'=>'ext.YSkebbySms.YSkebbySms',
		'username'=>'your Skebby user',
		'password'=>'your Skebby password',
	),
	...
);
There are a few more settings available.

3. Send messages as follows:
$result = Yii::app()->skebbySms->send([per-sms configurations]);
if ($result['result'])
    echo "Message sent";
else {
    echo "Message NOT sent: ".$result['message'];
}

USAGE EXAMPLE
=============
Yii::app()->skebbySms->send(array('to'=>'xxxxxx','message'=>'hello world'));
Yii::app()->skebbySms->getCredit();

CONFIGURATIONS
==============

All configurations can be set at sending time, but I recommend to set as much as you can in the component configuration. Also, setting too many options at sending time may slow down the process.

List of available configurations:

to			    Mobile phone number to send the SMS to.
message			The message.
username	    Skebby username.
password	    Skebby password.
ssl			    Default is FALSE. Whether to use a secure connection (https) or http.
debug			Default is FALSE. Whether to print debug information on screen. Useful when testing from console.
test			Default is FALSE. Whether to do only a test delivery, not really sending the message.

REQUIREMENTS
============

 * cURL
 * Tested only with YiiFramework v1.1.10
